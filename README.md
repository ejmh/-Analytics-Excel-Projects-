Project 1: Case Scenario
As your family debates which team is better, you listen and note the insights of the people around you, as you know it may help you to increase your understanding of your data.

 

You mention that there are multiple different ways you can compare the performance of the basketball teams and you will bring in your analysis to the next family dinner. You thank everyone for their contributions to the discussion, and ask them if they think you should pay attention to anything in the data in particular.

Project 2: Case Scenario
National Park Services (NPS) is a federal agency of the United States government responsible for managing all U.S. national parks, many American national monuments, and many other conservation and historical properties.

 

Information about visitation at units of the NPS is publicly available and may be downloaded at https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/.

Case Scenario
You work for a company that specializes in guided tours of national parks across the United States. As an assistant to the Director of Marketing, you were asked to analyze some visit data at selected national parks.

 

Your boss is specifically interested in the number of visitors as well as the trend of recreational visits over the years. The information will be used to develop marketing strategies, promotional packages, as well as advertising campaigns for the next five years.
